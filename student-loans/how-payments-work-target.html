  <h1>How Payments Work</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Learn how payments are allocated and applied to Unpaid Interest, Unpaid Principal, and any Unpaid Fees, if applicable.</p>

  <p>Your Account is Current</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, any Unpaid Fees are paid.</li>
    <li>Second, any Unpaid Interest is paid.</li>
    <li>Third, the payment is applied to the Unpaid Principal.</li>
    <li>We will apply any overpayment to next month's payment — <strong>unless you are enrolled in Auto Pay or instruct us to do otherwise.*</strong></li>

  </ul>
  <p>Your Account is Past Due</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, any Unpaid Fees are paid.</li>
    <li>Second, any Unpaid Interest is paid. Interest continues to accrue on your account daily. If your payment is past due, more of it will be applied to the interest that has accrued.</li>
    <li>Third, the payment is applied to the Unpaid Principal.</li>
    <li>We will apply any overpayment to next month's payment — <strong>unless you are enrolled in Auto Pay or instruct us to do otherwise.*</strong></li>

  </ul>
  <p><strong>*How to Send Overpayment Application Instructions</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>By check:</strong> Enclose your instructions for each loan, along with your loan IDs, <strong>on a separate piece of paper</strong> included with your check.</li>
