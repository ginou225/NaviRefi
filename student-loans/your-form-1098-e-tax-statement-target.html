      <h2>Your Form 1098-E Tax Statement</h2>
      <p>A Form 1098-E Student Loan Interest Statement shows the  amount of interest you paid on your eligible student loans during the previous  tax year. You may be able to deduct interest paid on your federal tax return,  which could reduce your taxable income.</p>
        <h4>Eligibility</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Loan customers who  have paid&nbsp;$600 or more in eligible student loan interest&nbsp;during the  tax year are automatically issued a Form 1098-E.</li>
        <li>We send Form  1098-E via eDelivery or USPS according to your account preferences.</li>
        <li>If you've paid  less than $600 in eligible student loan interest, we'll send you a Form 1098-E  electronically â€“ as long as you have chosen to receive your communications  electronically.</li>
        <li>Your tax  information is accessible online regardless of the amount of student loan  interest you paid during the previous tax year.</li>
      </ul>
