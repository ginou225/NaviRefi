	<h2>Help & Questions</h2>
		<h3>Applying for a Loan</h3>                         

	<p><a href="#contact1">Contact us with any questions about your student loan refinancing application.</a></p>
	

	<h4>Can I refinance both my federal <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight: bold;">and</span> private student loans?</h4>

	<p>When you apply for a NaviRefi Loan, you can include any qualified education loans that were taken out in your name and used to finance your education &mdash; both undergraduate and graduate federal and private student loans. </p>

	<p>Qualified education loans include loans that were incurred solely to pay for Qualified Higher Education Expenses, as that term is defined by Section 221(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C §221(d)(2)).</p>

	<p>Other loans (such as credit card or mortgage loans) can’t be included in the refinance even if they were used to pay education expenses. </p>

	<p>Also, you may be able to refinance student loans you previously consolidated or refinanced into a single loan.</p>

	<h4>What are the differences between student loan consolidation and student loan refinancing?</h4>

	<p>Consolidation and refinancing are sometimes used interchangeably, but student loan consolidation is most commonly used when referring to the Federal Direct Consolidation Loan program offered by the U.S. Department of Education (“Federal Direct Consolidation”).  Federal Direct Consolidation is the process of combining one or more <strong>federal student loans</strong> into a single new loan.  When you consolidate federal loans through the federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program, you’re combining one or more federal loans together with a resulting interest rate that’s defined by federal regulations to be the weighted average of your original loans’ rates.  You will have a new loan with potentially a new interest rate, a new monthly payment amount, and repayment length.</p>

	<p>Refinancing most commonly refers to private student loan refinancing, which gives you the ability to refinance one or more federal and/or <strong>private student loans</strong> into a single new private loan with new terms, including a new interest rate, monthly payment amount, and/or repayment length.</p>

	<p>Even if you’ve previously consolidated or refinanced your student loans, you may be able to further lower your interest rate and/or your monthly payment by refinancing with a NaviRefi Loan.</p>

	<p>Please note that refinancing federal student loans into a private student loan means loss of eligibility for federal loan benefits and repayment programs, such as Income-Driven Repayment.</p>

	<h4>What are the differences between federal student loans and private student loans?</h4>

	<p>Federal student loans are funded or guaranteed by the federal government. Congress sets interest rates on federal student loans. If you apply for financial aid, these are the types of loans you would receive as part of your federal student aid package. </p>


	<p>Private student loans are nonfederal loans, made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, or nonbank lender. Private lenders consider a borrower’s creditworthiness when deciding whether to lend and what rates to offer.  Students can often use a cosigner to cosign for their private loans, which may also help them get approved or obtain a lower interest rate than would otherwise be available with a private loan.  These are the types of loans you might apply for if your federal, state, and school financial aid did not cover all of your educational expenses.</p>


	<p>During repayment, private student loans typically have fewer options for deferment, forbearance, lower payment plans, and loan forgiveness than federal student loans.</p>

	<h4>Am I eligible to refinance my student loans?</h4>

	<p>Before you apply for a NaviRefi Loan, please be aware of our eligibility criteria. Loan eligibility depends on several factors, including your credit history, employment experience, and disposable income. Further, you must:</p>


	<ul>
		<li> Be at least the age of majority in your state and be able to enter into a binding contract.</li>
		<li>Be a United States citizen or non-citizen permanent resident of the United States.</li>
		<li>Be employed or have sufficient income from other sources.</li>
		<li>Have graduated with at least a two-year degree (Associate level degree or above) from a not-for-profit college or graduate program that is eligible for Title IV federal student aid.</li>
		<li>Have a minimum of $5,000 in qualified education loans that will be refinanced.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Do I need to have graduated to qualify?</h4>
	<p>Yes. You must have graduated with at least a two-year degree (Associate level degree or above) from a not-for-profit college or graduate program that is eligible for Title IV federal student aid.</p>

	<h4>How much money can I borrow?</h4>
	<p>We’re able to refinance a minimum of $5,000 in qualified education loans. The maximum amount you may be eligible to refinance is up to $150,000 for graduates of undergraduate and master’s degree programs and up to $250,000 for graduates of medical, dental, pharmacy, or veterinary doctorate programs.</p>

	<h4>What is the difference between fixed and variable rate loans?</h4>
	<p>Initially, a variable rate loan may be lower than your fixed rate option. However, over time, the variable rate may change at certain intervals based on the index for the variable rate, and the monthly payment amount may change as well. Variable rates are typically based on the index plus a margin.</p>

	<p>For instance, your variable rate may use the one-month LIBOR rate as the index.  LIBOR, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is the average of interest rates estimated by banks. LIBOR is a benchmark rate that some of the world’s leading banks charge each other for short-term loans. A variable rate that uses the one-month LIBOR as its index can be reset monthly based on the LIBOR rate published as of a certain day of the month.  The potential range of variable rates will be disclosed to you prior to submitting your application, with disclosure of your initial variable rate to follow if you are approved and if you accept the loan.</p>

	<p>A fixed rate is an interest rate that does not change over the life of the loan.  The potential range of fixed rates will be disclosed to you prior to submitting your application, with disclosure of your fixed rate to follow if you are approved and if you accept the loan.</p>

	<h4>What information will I need to complete my application?</h4>

	<p>Prior to starting your application, you will need your:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>Invitation code, if one is required.</li>
			<li>Social Security number.</li>
			<li>Employer name.</li>
			<li>Total annual income – the applicant’s combined income from all sources, such as salaries and wages, bonuses, investments, public assistance income,  self-employment income, overtime, alimony, and child support. Please note that you are not required to reveal alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments if you don’t want it to be considered in determining your eligibility for this loan.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>What’s the length of time I have to pay back my refinanced student loans?</h4>
	<p>You can choose to repay your loan between 5 and 15 years, available in yearly increments.</p>

	<h4>Is there a loan origination fee?</h4>
	<p>There is no origination fee on NaviRefi Loans.</p>

	<h4>Is there a reduced interest rate when I’m enrolled in Auto Pay?</h4>
	<p>Loans enrolled in Auto Pay can earn a .25% interest rate reduction.</p>
	<p>The reduced rate goes into effect the statement period following confirmation of your Auto Pay enrollment and continues as long as payments are successfully deducted by Auto Pay. The rate reduction is suspended during any periods when payments are postponed or not required. </p>

	<p>You can enroll in Auto Pay once you receive your welcome letter confirming that your NaviRefi Loan has been disbursed and is active on our loan servicing systems. </p>


	<h4>Do the borrower benefits and/or repayment options on my underlying loans carry over to my NaviRefi Loan?</h4>
	<p>First, you should know that refinancing private and federal student loans may not be the right decision for everyone.</p> 

	<p>If you refinance your federal and/or private student loans with a NaviRefi Loan, you will lose benefits associated with your underlying federal and private loans, including the ability to select Income-Driven Repayment or other flexible payments plans that are available to federal student loan borrowers.</p>

	<p>Federal student loans offer various deferment, forbearance, lower payment plans, and loan forgiveness options that are not available to you if you take out a refinanced loan.</p>

	<p>If you are currently serving on active duty in the military and you obtain a new loan (including a refinance loan), you may lose certain benefits under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) such as the 6% interest rate cap.</p>

	<h4>Can my spouse and I refinance all our loans into a NaviRefi Loan?</h4>

	<p>No. A NaviRefi Loan can only be used to refinance student loans that were previously in one person’s name. However, you and your spouse may each apply separately for refinancing.</p>

	<h4>Is there any penalty for prepaying my refinance loan?</h4>

	<p>No. There is no prepayment penalty or any other penalty for paying more than the minimum monthly payment or for paying off the entire loan early.</p>

	<h4>Who will be servicing my NaviRefi Loan?</h4>

	<p>Navient Solutions, LLC (“Navient”) is the servicer of NaviRefi Loans, under the NaviRefi brand.</p>

	<p>Our goal is to provide a consistent and seamless customer experience for the entire life of the loan.</p>

	<h3>Managing Your Account</h3>
	<p><a href="#contact">Contact us with any questions about your NaviRefi Loan.</a></p>
	<h4>Can I pay more than my monthly payment amount?</h4>

	<p>You can always pay more than your monthly payment amount, without penalty, to reduce your Current Balance. By paying more now, you'll pay less over the life of the loan. </p>

	<p>If your account is current and you make an overpayment, the extra funds will reduce the amount of any future payments. For example, if you pay an extra $25 and your Monthly Payment Amount is $100, your next payment due will be $75. If the extra funds are more than the next Monthly Payment Amount, your billing statement will show zero due. Even if you have a zero amount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total costs of borrowing. You can contact us to set your account so all future overpayments do not apply to your next payment and you will be due for next month’s payment as usual.</p>

	<p>Note that for loans enrolled in Auto Pay, we'll extract your Monthly Payment Amount automatically each month regardless of any overpayments.</p>

	<h4>Can I increase my Auto Pay amount?</h4>
	<p>Your recurring Auto Pay amount can’t exceed your monthly payment due at this time, but you can make additional payments by selecting Make a Payment on your Summary page.</p>

	<h4>When will my payment post?</h4>
	<p>Please allow at least 2 business days for processing, from the scheduled date for electronic payments or the date delivered for mailed payments.</p>

	<p>Once it’s processed, your payment will be credited effective as of the scheduled electronic payment date or the date the mailed payment was received.</p>

	<p>Online payments made by 11:59 PM ET will be credited effective as of the current date – including weekends and banking holidays.</p>

	<p>If you’re enrolled in Auto Pay, please note that your payment will be effective on your due date. </p>

	<p>Please allow time for mailing when reviewing your account for recently mailed payments, and keep in mind that mailed payments are only processed on business days.</p>

	<h4>Can I change my due date?</h4>

	<p>We’re happy to change your monthly due date to one that works better for you. You may choose any date from the 3rd through the 22nd of each month.</p>  
	
	<p>Note that your loans must be current for us to make this change, and it may take up to one full billing period for the date to change.</p>

	<a href="#contact">Contact us to make the change for you.</a>
	
	<p>We’ll notify you when we’ve processed your request, or you can check your Summary for the changed due date.</p>

	<h4>How are payments applied?</h4>
	<p>When payments are received, they’re typically applied first to any unpaid fees, then to unpaid interest, and then to unpaid principal.</p>
	<p><a href="https://navirefi.com/student-loans/how-payments-work.html">Learn more about How Payments Work</a> </p>
	

	<h4>Can I make a payment with a credit or debit card?</h4>
	<p>You can make payments over the phone using a debit card issued by a U.S. bank. </p>
	<p>Debit card payments can’t be made online at this time.</p>
	<p>We do not accept credit card payments.</p>
	<p><a href="#contact">Contact Us to make a debit card payment.</a></p>
		

	<h4>Why did my monthly payment amount increase?</h4>
	<p>The monthly payment amount can increase when:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your loan has a variable interest rate and the rate increases.</li>
		<li>Due to past periods of delinquency or inconsistencies in your payment history, an increase in your monthly payment may be required to ensure the loan is paid off within its stated repayment term.</li>
		<li>Unpaid interest is capitalized – added to your unpaid principal balance – causing the interest to accrue on a higher balance, making your payments higher.  Capitalization typically occurs at the end of periods of deferment or forbearance.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Is the interest I pay tax deductible?</h4>
	<p>You may be able to deduct up to $2,500 of the interest you pay each year on qualified education loans, which could reduce your taxable income on your federal tax return. </p>
	<p><a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/form-1098-e-student-loan-interest-statement" target="_blank">Learn more on the IRS website </a></p>
	
	<p>Form 1098-E is a Student Loan Interest Statement for borrowers who have paid $600 or more in eligible student loan interest during the calendar year.</p> 
	<p>You may be able to deduct an amount lower than $600. Consult your tax advisor if you have questions. </p>
	<p>Cosigners are not eligible to receive a Form 1098-E for loans they cosigned.</p>
	<p>We are not able to provide you with tax advice. Your tax advisor can provide additional information about the tax treatment of your student loan interest.</p>

	<h4>How does interest accrue?</h4>
	<p>Interest begins to accrue on the day of disbursement and continues to accrue daily on your unpaid principal balance until the loan is paid in full. </p>
	<p>Refer to your loan's promissory note for specific information regarding interest accrual.</p>

	<h4>What is capitalized interest?</h4>
	<p>Capitalization is when unpaid accrued interest is added to your unpaid principal balance. Capitalization typically occurs at the end of periods of deferment or forbearance, and also as permitted or required by your promissory note.</p>
	<p>As a result of capitalization, more interest may accrue over the life of the loan, and the monthly payment amount may increase after capitalization.</p>

	<h4>Are there repayment incentives / loan benefits available?</h4>
	<p>A .25% interest rate reduction is available on eligible NaviRefi Loans enrolled in Auto Pay. </p>

	<h4>What is my loan’s APR and where can I find it?</h4>
	<p>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is disclosed at the time you take out your loan. Refer to the disclosures issued to you during the application process, at approval, and at your acceptance of the loan.</p>
	<p>APR represents the annual cost of borrowing money, including interest, fees, and premiums, based on the expected term of your loan.</p>





	<h4>Can I get a letter with the details of my loan to show to a landlord or mortgage company?</h4>
	<p><a href="#contact">Contact us to generate an account information email for you.</a></p>
		

	<h4>As a military service member, what are my benefits and how do I request them?</h4>
	<p>As a member of the military, you may be eligible for certain benefits and repayment options to help you manage your student loans while you’re serving your country.  For instance, if you enter active duty military service after obtaining a loan, you may be eligible for benefits under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).</p>

	<p>Please note: If you are currently serving on active duty in the military and you obtain a new loan (including a refinance loan), you may lose certain benefits under the SCRA such as the 6% interest rate cap.</p>

	<p>In addition, service members can call our dedicated Military Benefits Team at 844-381-6621. </p>

	<p>Outside our hours of operation, please leave us a message and we’ll contact you as soon as possible.</p>

	<h4>What happens if I file for bankruptcy?</h4>
	<p>If we receive notice that a party to a loan has filed for bankruptcy, we will honor the automatic stay of the Bankruptcy Court and cease collection efforts against that person while the automatic stay is in place.</p>
	<p>As qualified education loans, NaviRefi Loans may not be dischargeable in bankruptcy. We are not able to provide you with legal advice. Please consult your legal advisor for further information.</p>

	<h4>Will these loans appear on my credit report?</h4>
	<p>Shortly after a NaviRefi Loan is disbursed and enters repayment, we begin providing monthly account updates to four national consumer reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, and Innovis. These updates include the loan balance and status, including whether payments are current or delinquent.  We report to consumer reporting agencies in accordance with industry standard reporting guidelines.</p>

	<p>To ensure that your account is reported in good standing, make all your payments on time. </p>
	<p>Enrolling in Auto Pay is a great way to stay current with your payments.</p>
	<p>To review information that has been reported to the consumer reporting agencies, you can obtain a free copy of your credit report on an annual basis. Go to <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com.</a>  </p>
	
	<p>Please note that NaviRefi Loans are reported under the name "Navient" because Navient Solutions, LLC (“Navient”) is the loan servicer and data furnisher.</p>
