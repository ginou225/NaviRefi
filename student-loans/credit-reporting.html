      <h2>Credit Reporting</h2>
        <p>In addition to helping our student loan customers achieve successful loan repayment, we are committed to industry standards when it comes  to relaying important information to consumer reporting agencies. We understand  that the protection and factual portrayal of credit and your credit score is an  integral part of your financial life.</p>
        <h4>Credit Basics</h4>
        <p>Your credit report is a record of your history as a borrower, maintained by  a consumer reporting agency based on information reported by your existing and  prior lenders. Other financial obligations such as liens, judgments, medical,  and other debt may appear on a credit report as well.</p>
        <p>When you apply for new credit, potential lenders may review your full  credit report but they often make decisions based on your credit score. The  weight any particular lender gives to credit scores varies by lender and is  entirely determined by the lenders themselves.</p>
        <p>Your financial habits are reflected in your credit score – an important  number. Credit scores offer lenders a glimpse at your financial practices, with  various factors such as your bill paying habits, indebtedness, and how you&rsquo;ve  handled past financial hurdles captured in a single number.</p>
        <p>It may be the key factor in many borrowing situations for financial  institutions who attempt to measure your credit worthiness. It can be the  difference between financing your dream car or, sadly, being told you don&rsquo;t  qualify for a loan. Negative credit information may reflect on your credit  report for up to seven years from when a delinquency began and bankruptcy data  may reflect for up to ten years.</p>
        <p>If you ever struggle to make your student loan payments, let us know.  Remember, making payments in a timely manner is essential to maintaining good  credit history.</p>
        <h4>Understanding the Facts</h4>
        <p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act is a federal law that dictates how financial  institutions – such as Navient – provide information to the consumer reporting  agencies. It sets industry rules which encompass both the protection of the  privacy of information and what and how information may be reported. Accuracy  and integrity of information reported is one of our most important obligations  under the law.</p>
        <p>In addition to your interests, the financial sector relies on fair and  accurate credit reporting. When Navient forwards information to the consumer  reporting agencies, we do so with the mutual  understanding that lenders need up to date facts on borrowers in order to make  good credit decisions.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to always furnish accurate and complete reporting. However, if  you disagree with any of the accuracy of our reports, it&rsquo;s your right to dispute and our obligation to investigate.</p>
        <h4>Courtesy Retractions and Credit Reporting</h4>
        <p>When information is reported accurately, the Fair Credit Reporting Act does  not permit Navient to reverse or provide courtesy retractions of information to  consumer reporting agencies. This ensures we provide information as accurately  as possible – even when it&rsquo;s not the outcome a customer has hoped for.</p>
        <p>If you recognize an error on your credit report related to a loan serviced  by Navient, contact the individual consumer reporting agency reflecting the  error or reach out to us directly in writing. Be sure to provide a detailed explanation for the basis of the dispute and any necessary documentation.</p>
        <p>Supporting materials can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A copy of the relevant sections of your credit report highlighting the disputed reporting.</li>
          <li>Canceled checks or bank statements reflecting loan payments you believe were not applied to your account.</li>
          <li>An identity theft report and supporting information if you believe your loan is the result of identity theft. This requires filing a report with your local police department or submitting an identity theft claim at FTC.gov.</li>
          <li>Any other information you believe is pertinent to your claim.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of your dispute, you&rsquo;ll need to include the account number and your  name, address, and telephone number. We&rsquo;ll notify you in writing with the  result of our review.</p>
        <p>Questions about specific factors impacting your credit score should be  directed to the consumer reporting agency from whom you obtained the score. We  do not produce credit scores. Credit scoring methods are proprietary to the  companies that produce them.</p>
