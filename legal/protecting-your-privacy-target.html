      <h2>NaviRefi.com Online Consumer Information Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Effective: August 26, 2017</p>
      <p>Navient Solutions, LLC (“Navient”) is dedicated to helping our clients and the people we serve along the path to their financial success. We respect the privacy and security of information about our customers and visitors to this website. This Online Consumer Information Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes our privacy practices concerning information collected in connection with the NaviRefi student loan refinance product website (the “Site”), which is located at <a href="#">NaviRefi.com</a>, and sets forth our policies on how we collect, use, and disclose information collected on this Site. By visiting our Site and/or using the features made available to you on the Site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>


      <p>Navient also shares customer information with affiliates and outside companies. Navient’s <a href="#">Privacy Notice</a> describes our principles and practices regarding how we share customer information with affiliates and outside companies.</p>




      <h4>Information We Collect</h4>


      <p>We may collect both Personal Information and Other Information in connection with the services on the Site. “Personal Information” is any information that alone or together with other information in Navient’s possession relates to an identified or identifiable person, such as name, phone number, email, address, and online account information such as username and password. “Other Information” is any additional information that is not Personal Information, such as information about usage of the Site that does not identify you personally or certain information that we or third parties collect about you in other contexts. If we combine Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h4>Personal Information We Collect Directly from You</h4>

      <p>We collect Personal Information when you voluntarily choose to provide such information directly to us, such as when you register for access to the Site, fill out an application for a loan or credit, create an account with us, manage your account on our Site, contact us with inquiries, request information or materials from us, or otherwise interact with our Site. Such information may include your name, phone number, email, address, social security number, date of birth, information regarding your academic record, and online account information such as a username and password.</p>





      <h4>Personal Information We Receive from Third Parties</h4>
      <p>We may collect and receive Personal Information about you from third parties, such as our affiliates, joint-marketing partners, consumer reporting agencies, or third-party data providers.  Such information may include demographic information, income or credit information, information regarding your academic record, or information about the products and services that we believe may interest you.</p>






      <h4>Log Data and Other Information</h4>

      <p>We and our affiliates and our third-party service providers may automatically collect and store certain information when you visit or use the Site, including information such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device you use to connect to the Internet, browser type, device type, mobile device ID (UDID), screen size and resolution, Internet Service Provider (ISP), the Site you came from and exited to, operating system, user agent string, Internet connection type, links you click, searches conducted on the Site, date/time stamp, and pages visited. To obtain such information, we may use logs or applications that recognize your computer and gather information about its online activity.</p>



      <h4>Cookies and Other Technologies</h4>

      <p>We and our affiliates or our third-party service providers may place and read data stored (via session and/or persistent "cookies" or other device specific storage capabilities) on the device you are using, and use other technologies such as Web beacons (including clear GIFs, tracking pixels, JavaScript, and tags), when you visit or use our Site or open a Navient email. Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device for a variety of purposes, including to identify your device and/or your account when you return to the Site. A web beacon is an electronic file or code that usually consists of a single-pixel image or tag that is embedded on a website or in an email. We and our service providers may use web beacons and cookies to determine whether and when you receive and open our emails; these beacons and cookies may also capture information such as the type of device, operating system, email program, and web browser used to view the email or the advertisement, the IP address from which you opened the email or the advertisement, whether you click on any advertisements or links in the email, and which documents you download. These technologies enable us to gauge the effectiveness, relevance, and value of our email communications, as well as to target relevant advertising to you and to measure the impact of that advertising on your Navient relationships.</p>



      <p>You can generally remove, block, or disable cookies by using the settings located in your browser. If you decide to remove or not accept cookies, some features and services on our Site may not work properly and the offers we provide when you visit or use our Site may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. For further information about deleting or blocking cookies, please visit: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>. Information about how to opt out of the use of cookies for certain purposes (such as interest-based advertising) is discussed below in the section titled “Third-Party Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.”</p>




      <h4>How We Use The Information That We Collect</h4>

Our service providers may collect, process, and retain information about you directly on behalf of Navient.

      <p><em><strong>Our Lending Partners:</strong></em>The loans you obtain through the Site are provided by WebBank.

      <p><em><strong>Legal Purposes:</strong></em> We also may use or share your Personal or Other Information with third parties when we believe, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary:</p>



      <ul>
      <li>to comply with applicable law or a court order, subpoena, or other legal process;</li>
      <li>to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of our terms and conditions, or situations involving threats to our property or the property or physical safety of any person or third party or for risk management purposes;</li>

      <p><em><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</strong></em> From time to time, Navient may share aggregated or de-identified information about users of the Site or Navient’s products and services, such as sharing reports on the usage of the Site or Navient’s services for regulatory reporting or marketing purposes.</p>



      <h4>Third-Party Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising </h4>
      <p>We partner with third parties to collect information to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting. These third parties may set and access cookies on your computer or other device and may use web beacons (including clear GIFs, tracking pixels, JavaScript, and tags) to collect information about your activity on the Site and how you respond to our marketing emails. In particular, the Site may use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">Google Analytics</a> or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html">Adobe Analytics</a> to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</p>

      <p>We also partner with third parties to provide targeted advertising services that are customized based on your online activities over time and across unaffiliated websites (“Interest-Based Advertising”). These third parties may use cookies and web beacons (including clear GIFs, tracking pixels, JavaScript, and tags) to collect information about your activity on our Site, and they may combine it with information about your activity on other, unaffiliated websites, information that we have collected about you in other contexts, or demographic information. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Site to target online ads for Navient services to you on non-Navient websites and to send targeted marketing emails to you. For information about behavioral advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-digital-advertising">Network Advertising Initiative website</a> or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance website</a>.</p>


      <p>The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies. You may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/">here</a>, or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance program by opting out <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/">here</a>. Please note that the opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out, and therefore you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete or reset your cookies, change browsers, or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again.</p>

      <p>Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but you may opt out of interest-based advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative and for companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting the opt-out pages described above. Please see the <a href="#">About Our Ads</a> page for additional information about the ways in which we may display ads to users while on our Site.</p>

      <h4>Reviewing and Updating Your Information</h4>

      <p>Unless prohibited by law, you have the right, upon reasonable notice, to view any Personal Information collected from you through your visits to or use of our Sites, to make corrections to such information if necessary, or to request that such information be removed from our systems. You may do so by contacting us at the address indicated at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>


      <h4>Security</h4>

      <p>In our information technology systems environment, Navient maintains commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion. However, no security program is foolproof, and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal or other information.</p>

      <h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>


      <p>The Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not intend to collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected this information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly take all reasonable steps to delete the data from our system.</p>

      <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>


      <p>Technology and the Internet are rapidly changing. Navient therefore is likely to make changes to the Site in the future and as a consequence will need to revise this Privacy Policy to reflect those changes. Navient will post all such changes on the Site, with an “effective date” indicating when the changes will take effect, so you should review this page periodically.</p>
