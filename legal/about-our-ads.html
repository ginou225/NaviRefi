      <h2>About Our Ads</h2>
      <p>Effective: August 26, 2017</p>
      <p>Navient Solutions, LLC (“Navient”) participates in advertising online (e.g., on pages on the NaviRefi student loan refinance product website (the “Site”), which is located at NaviRefi.com, and on third-party websites and where our ads appear) and offline (e.g., through our call centers, emails, and direct marketing). In order to make the advertising informative and useful, some of these ads may be targeted or tailored to your interests. Set forth below is additional information about our online advertisement activities, including targeted online ads (sometimes referred to as interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising).</p>

      <p>Additional information about Navient’s advertising practices and how Navient collects, uses, and discloses information can be found in our NaviRefi.com <a href="#">Online Consumer Information Privacy Policy</a> (“Privacy Policy”).</p>

      <h4>Third-Party Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising </h4>
      <p>We partner with third parties to collect information to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting. These third parties may set and access cookies on your computer or other device and may use web beacons (including clear GIFs, tracking pixels, JavaScript, and tags) to collect information about your activity on the Site and how you respond to our marketing emails. In particular, the Site may use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">Google Analytics</a> or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html">Adobe Analytics</a> to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</p>

      <p>We also partner with third parties to provide targeted advertising services that are customized based on your online activities over time and across unaffiliated websites (“Interest-Based Advertising”). These third parties may use cookies and web beacons (including clear GIFs, tracking pixels, JavaScript, and tags) to collect information about your activity on our Site, and they may combine it with information about your activity on other, unaffiliated websites, information that we have collected about you in other contexts, or demographic information. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Site to target online ads for Navient services to you on non-Navient websites and to send targeted marketing emails to you. For information about behavioral advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality, visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-digital-advertising">Network Advertising Initiative website</a> or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance website</a>.</p>

      <p>The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies. You may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/">here</a>, or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance program by opting out <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/">here</a>. Please note that the opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out, and therefore you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete or reset your cookies, change browsers, or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again.</p>

      <p>Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but you may opt out of interest-based advertising of companies within the Network 
      Advertising Initiative and for companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting the opt-out pages described above.
      </p>

      <h4>Changes to this Page and Our Privacy Policy</h4>

      <p>Technology and the Internet are rapidly changing. Navient therefore is likely to make changes to the Site in the future and as a consequence will need to revise this page and our Privacy Policy to reflect those changes. Navient will post all such changes on the Site, with an “effective date” indicating when the changes will take effect, so you should review this page and our Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
